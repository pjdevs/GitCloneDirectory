# GitCloneDirectory

A simple helper program to download a specific directory in a Github repository.

## Usage

The project was developped with .NET 6. You can run it and build it with `dotnet`.

This program is a CLI, run it to get the help menu.

## Implementation

The implementation is simple and probably not efficient as the program make a GET request for every file in the repo to download it raw.
